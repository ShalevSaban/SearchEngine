# 💬 Real-Time Sentiment Analysis with Reactive Programming & NLP

This project implements a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline that continuously analyzes the emotional tone of words or phrases provided by the user. It pulls live data from a news source (via API or web scraping), optionally integrates with Twitter, and reacts in real time to new content — all using reactive programming principles.

---

## 📌 Overview

The system enables high-throughput, low-latency sentiment detection by streaming new content (such as news headlines or tweets), applying NLP-based sentiment analysis, and displaying results live.

Users can enter keywords, topics, or phrases, and the system tracks how positively or negatively they're being discussed in real time.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

| Technology              | Purpose |
|--------------------------|---------|
| ⚛️ Reactive Programming   | Non-blocking, event-driven data processing |
| 🧠 NLP (Natural Language Processing) | Sentiment analysis of text |
| 🐦 Twitter API           | Optional data source for live social mentions |
| 🌐 News API / Feed       | Pulls real-time headlines/content |
| 🖥️ Continuous Browser Feed | Live UI stream of results (optional) |
| ☁️ Deployment            | Cloud/container-ready for scalable operation |

## 🔁 System Flow

1. **User provides a word or phrase** to monitor sentiment on.
2. The system starts listening to **news APIs** or **Twitter feed** (if enabled).
3. Every new piece of content is pushed through a **reactive pipeline**:
    - Filter content that includes the user query
    - Analyze the text using an **NLP sentiment model**
    - Assign a score: positive, neutral, or negative
4. The sentiment result is published immediately to:
    - The live feed/dashboard (browser or terminal)
    - A log or database for historical tracking

## 📊 Example Usage

**User Input:**
```
Track sentiment for: "Artificial Intelligence"
```

**Live Feed Output:**
```
[+0.82] "AI is revolutionizing healthcare systems across Europe"
[-0.34] "Fears rise as AI threatens millions of jobs"
[+0.10] "Artificial intelligence usage increases in small businesses"
```

**What happens:**
- New headlines are pulled from a news API every few seconds.
- Sentiment scores are computed in real time using pre-trained NLP models.
- Each result is classified and displayed live.

## 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Engine

- Uses rule-based or machine learning NLP models (e.g. VADER, TextBlob, or custom transformers).
- Supports word-level or phrase-level polarity scoring.
- Can be extended to multilingual sentiment detection.

---

## 🌍 Reactive Design

- Built using **reactive programming** (e.g., Project Reactor, RxJava, or Spring WebFlux).
- All data pipelines are **non-blocking**, allowing the system to scale with minimal threads.
- Perfect for **high-velocity streams** like live tweets or breaking news.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- Can run locally or be containerized with Docker.
- Optional Web UI feed can be deployed via React or simple browser-based terminal.
- Scalable horizontally with microservices or message queues (e.g., Kafka for backpressure).

---

## 🧠 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add advanced transformer-based sentiment model (BERT or RoBERTa)
- [ ] Add heatmap for sentiment over time
- [ ] Connect to Reddit or other social feeds
- [ ] Visualize positivity score as graph
- [ ] Enable user-defined sentiment thresholds and alerts
